# LocationStream

Stream your location automatically to Facebook, twitter, and foursquare from your mobile phone.


Whenever you stay at a meaningful location for more than 15 minutes, the app will
post your location information to your Facebook, twitter, and foursquare.


Collect your locations and figure out which locations are meaningful to you and how long you spend your time at those meaningful locations.
